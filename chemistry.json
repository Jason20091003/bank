  "what is the fundamental nature of the chemical process known as fermentation?": "It is a catabolic process carried out anaerobically.",
  "what is the primary molecule broken down in the process of fermentation, according to the text?": "Glucose.",
  "fermentation is defined as a process that breaks down molecules under which specific condition?": "Anaerobically.",
  "which organism is explicitly mentioned as carrying out alcoholic fermentation?": "Yeast.",
  "what are the two primary products of alcoholic fermentation, as summarized in the reaction?": "Ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide.",
  "what molecule, along with nadh, acts as a reactant in the summary equation for alcoholic fermentation after glycolysis?": "Pyruvic acid.",
  "alcoholic fermentation is used in the production of which food items?": "Beer, wine, and other alcoholic beverages.",
  "besides producing alcoholic beverages, what role does alcoholic fermentation play in bread making?": "It causes the bread dough to rise.",
  "what is the specific substance responsible for forming the air spaces (bubbles) seen in a slice of bread?": "Carbon dioxide.",
  "what happens to the small amount of alcohol produced in bread dough during the baking process?": "It evaporates.",
  "lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvic acid into what specific molecule?": "Lactic acid.",
  "how does lactic acid fermentation differ from alcoholic fermentation regarding gas production?": "LAF does not give off carbon dioxide, while AF does.",
  "what are the reactants in the summary equation for lactic acid fermentation after glycolysis?": "Pyruvic acid and NADH.",
  "which molecule, alongside $\\text{nad}^+$, is a product of the overall lactic acid fermentation reaction summary?": "Lactic acid.",
  "lactic acid fermentation of vegetables is a common way of preserving fresh vegetables, including which korean staple?": "Kimchi.",
  "what approximate percentage of salt is added when preserving raw vegetables through lactic acid fermentation?": "2 percent.",
  "lactic acid is described as a waste product during fermentation by certain bacteria important to which industry?": "Food.",
  "which list contains food products made with the help of bacteria that produce lactic acid?": "Cheese, yogurt, and buttermilk.",
  "what substance contributes the familiar sour taste to fermented dairy products like yogurt and sour cream?": "Lactic acid.",
  "what is the role of lactic acid bacteria (lab) often added as a starter culture in cheese making?": "To consume lactose and convert it into lactic acid.",
  "what is the milk sugar consumed and converted by lactic acid bacteria (lab) during cheese making?": "Lactose.",
  "in addition to bacteria, what other organism is mentioned as a lactic acid fermenter?": "Humans.",
  "which cells in the human body are described as being best adapted to producing atp by lactic acid fermentation?": "Muscle cells.",
  "under what condition do many human body cells produce atp by lactic acid fermentation?": "During brief periods without enough oxygen.",
  "how long can the initial supply of atp in muscle cells power a rapid activity, such as the start of a sprint?": "A few seconds.",
  "to keep going after the initial atp supply is used up, an athlete must immediately generate new atp by which two pathways?": "Cellular respiration or lactic acid fermentation.",
  "for a leisurely swim, which process would be able to produce all the atp needed?": "Cellular respiration (aerobic respiration).",
  "sprinters (swimming or running) primarily rely on lactic acid fermentation for what purpose?": "For bursts of quick energy.",
  "how is the \"oxygen debt\" incurred by the swimmers repaid after the race?": "With plenty of heavy breathing.",
  "for exercise that lasts longer than about 90 seconds, what is the only way to continue generating a supply of atp?": "Cellular respiration.",
  "why do well-conditioned athletes have to pace themselves during long races?": "Because cellular respiration releases energy more slowly than fermentation.",
  "in what form does the body primarily store energy in muscle cells and other tissues?": "Glycogen.",
  "what is the body's fuel source after the stores of glycogen are used up (after about 15-20 minutes of activity)?": "Other stored molecules, including fats.",
  "which of the following is regenerated as a product of the overall alcoholic fermentation reaction summary": "NAD+",
  "both alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation share which crucial function": "they both regenerate NAD+"
